title:  "May 12: FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"

- My email is matt@hillvt.com, you can call or text me on 8028990704. Contact me anytime for help.
- Get a [new copy of the course materials](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20250418.pptx), there aren't too many changes but why not have a new one, right?

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs (that Tom is talking about) the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [the FFIEC has to say about remote access](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Lorraine (and others) wanted to know when the FDIC IG said its [biggest challenges were all in tech](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2019/02/fdics-top-3-challenges-are-all-tech-related/154972/). Geez, it's older than I thought (2019!), but honestly, I still stand by the sentiment. Banking is IT now. This is why fintech, crypto, and other tech issues are so important.

- Here's [the "Magic VPN Box" animation](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) I was talking about. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model operations, or want a demonstration of what tunnling is.

- Alex Li made a great point after class: Even though something like [Wireguard doesn't have FIPS certification](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search) or FFIEC audit logging, that doesn't mean you must call out a bank for using it. You just have to be okay with their approach on your own terms. <em>Cue animated discussion about common business practice vs certification...</em>

- Garrett shared [some intel from purewl](https://www.purewl.com/vpn-vulnerabilities-you-should-know-about/) about VPN vulnerabilities. There's a bit of scaremongering because they're a security vendor, but it's interesting nonetheless.

- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only discovered last year. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."

- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.
  
### Tuesday, May 13, 2025

- I think Tammy made a point yesterday that [maybe all regs aren't so out of date...](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/05/safeguards-rule-notification-requirement-now-effect)
  
- They're a vendor, but that doesn't make them evil. [This explainer from Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-dns-security) about DNS security is a good cheat sheet and jumping-off point for further study.

- The FIDO alliance has [improved their site](https://fidoalliance.org/), which now does a decent job of [explaining how passkeys work](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/).

- Crowdstrike has a good primer on the [basics of Zero Trust Architectures](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/).

- Here's another [**Great Explainer from the EFF**](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you) on how to choose a VPN, depending on your needs and requirements. There's also some basic refresher stuff in there.

- ##### Remote Access Exercise Assignments

- [Group 1: Barracuda](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/zero-trust-access)
- [Group 2: Sonicwall](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/remote-access/)
- [Group 3: Palo Alto](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/globalprotect)
  
##### Exercise Questions to Consider

- What is the primary use case for the solution you saw?
- To whom is it directed? That is, who are they selling it to?
- Would it be useful in a community bank?
- Would you be happy to see it in a bank you examined?
- What did you personally think of the solution?
