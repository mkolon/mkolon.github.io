- my email is matt@hillvt.com, you can mail me for anything you need, anytime.
- if you have connectivity problems, you can also text me on 8028990704.
- get a [new copy of the course materials](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20250418.pptx), there aren't too many changes but why not have a new one, right?

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs (that Tom is talking about) the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [the FFIEC has to say about remote access](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Here's [the "Magic VPN Box" animation](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) I was talking about. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model imaginings.

- Alex Li made a great point after class: Even though something like [Wireguard doesn't have FIPS certification](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search) or FFIEC audit logging, that doesn't mean you must call out a bank for using it. You just have to be okay with their approach on your own terms. <em>Cue discussion about common business practice and certification...<em>

- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only discovered last year. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."

- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.
