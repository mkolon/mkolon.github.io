title:  "May 12: FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"
---

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit funny.
- Are the VPNs that Tom is talking about the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
- Here's what [the FFIEC has to say about VPNs](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about remote access systems. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Shoot a note to matt@hillvt.com if you have any questions, or just ask them in class.
