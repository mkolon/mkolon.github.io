### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [look at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long.
- Ask yourself if the VPN Tom is talking about is the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Are there differences and/or similarities?

- Shoot a note to mkolon@hillvt.com if you have any questions.
