title:  "May 12: FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"

- my email is matt@hillvt.com, you can mail me for anything you need, anytime.
- if you have connectivity problems, you can also text me on 8028990704.
- get a [new copy of the course materials](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20250418.pptx), there aren't too many changes but why not have a new one, right?

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
- Are the VPNs (that Tom is talking about) the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
- Here's what [the FFIEC has to say about remote access](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Shoot a note to matt@hillvt.com if you have any questions, or just ask them in class.
