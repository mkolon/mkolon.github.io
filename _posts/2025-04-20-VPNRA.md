- My email is matt@hillvt.com, you can call or text me on 8028990704. Contact me anytime for help.
- Get a [new copy of the course materials](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20250418.pptx), there aren't too many changes but why not have a new one, right?

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs (that Tom is talking about) the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [the FFIEC has to say about remote access](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Lorraine (and others) wanted to know when the FDIC IG said its [biggest challenges were all in tech](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2019/02/fdics-top-3-challenges-are-all-tech-related/154972/). Geez, it's older than I thought (2019!), but honestly, I still stand by the sentiment. Banking is IT now. This is why fintech, crypto, and other tech issues are so important.

- Here's [the "Magic VPN Box" animation](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) I was talking about. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model operations, or want a demonstration of what tunnling is.

- Alex Li made a great point after class: Even though something like [Wireguard doesn't have FIPS certification](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search) or FFIEC audit logging, that doesn't mean you must call out a bank for using it. You just have to be okay with their approach on your own terms. <em>Cue animated discussion about common business practice vs certification...</em>

- Garrett shared [some intel from purewl](https://www.purewl.com/vpn-vulnerabilities-you-should-know-about/) about VPN vulnerabilities. There's a bit of scaremongering because they're a security vendor, but it's interesting nonetheless.

- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only discovered last year. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."

- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.

- I think Tammy made a point yesterday that [maybe all regs aren't so out of date...](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/05/safeguards-rule-notification-requirement-now-effect)
  
- They're a vendor, but that doesn't make them evil. [This explainer from Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-dns-security) about DNS security is a good cheat sheet and jumping-off point for further study.

- The FIDO alliance has [improved their site](https://fidoalliance.org/), which now does a decent job of [explaining how passkeys work](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/).

- Crowdstrike has a good primer on the [basics of Zero Trust Architectures](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/).

- Here's another [**Great Explainer from the EFF**](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you) on how to choose a VPN, depending on your needs and requirements. There's also some basic refresher stuff in there.

- ##### Remote Access Exercise Assignments

- [Group 1: Barracuda](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/zero-trust-access)
- [Group 2: Sonicwall](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/remote-access/)
- [Group 3: Palo Alto](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/globalprotect)
  
##### Exercise Questions to Consider

- What is the primary use case for the solution you saw?
- To whom is it directed? That is, who are they selling it to?
- Would it be useful in a community bank?
- Would you be happy to see it in a bank you examined?
- What did you personally think of the solution?

- Are you aware of the [**FDIC Podcast**](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/fdic/episodes/Verifying-Identity-in-a-Digital-World-e1crru9)? I was pretty amazed to see episodes about, among other things, Verifying Identity in a Digital World.

- I mentioned that Apple iMessage (their IP-based messaging client) has [**some privacy enhancements available**](https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-advanced-data-protection-works-and-how-to-turn-it-on/).

- There are many, many online treatments of cryptography topics. Here are a few decent ones:
  - [**Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/asymmetric-vs-symmetric-encryption/)
  - [**Public Key Infrastructure**](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/public-key-infrastructure)
  - I must admit I love Cloudflare. Explainers like these, on [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) and [**SSL Certificates**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/), are a big part of why I feel that way.



- After class, Alex Li asked an interesting question about Fortinet VPN client certificates. [**Here are the docs**](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.2/administration-guide/266506/ssl-vpn-with-certificate-authentication), and here is [**an explanation of why you might need them**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2164397/why-should-i-authenticate-a-client-using-a-certificate). And for the most masochistic among you, there is a [**NIST doc detailing the use of IPsec VPNs**](https://chatgpt.com/c/6823de41-2e28-8002-91ea-97f1432fc680) that covers client certificates in depth (in section 3.3.1). The short answer is that an IT department might use these when they are concerned about authenticating the client machine as well as the user.

- I accidentally ran into this guide on [**Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions**](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Sep/28/2002863184/-1/-1/0/CSI_SELECTING-HARDENING-REMOTE-ACCESS-VPNS-20210928.PDF) while looking for something else. Honest I did! It's a few years old, but then again it's from the NSA, so it's pretty good, too.

- Here are a couple of docs I've dreamed up over the years that you could find useful. A [**list of controls**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Controls.docx) and [**one of documentation**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Docs.docx) that might be useful in considering bank VPN and Remote Access implementations. **These are not official FDIC documents**, just my slightly informed thinking.

- I also took a shot at making a [**Remote Access Risk Assessment**](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/Remote_Access_Risk_Assessment.pdf). What do you think of this? Is it useful, perhaps as the start of something you might make yourself?

- You can't do anything today without encountering an Artificial Intelligence angle, and [**VPNs are no exception**](https://medium.com/@44dying/the-impact-of-ai-on-vpn-security-predictive-threat-detection-and-response-d371a34c71c0). We may not see [**AI doing its work in the VPN context**](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-ai-work-in-vpns/), but that doesn't mean VPN and networking companies aren't using it. What could that look like for banks?
- In case you have questions about Wireguard, [**here's some good lightweight tech info**](https://www.techradar.com/vpn/what-is-wireguard) from TechRadar.
