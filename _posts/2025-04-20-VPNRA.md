title:  "May 12: FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"
---

### Monday, May 12, 2025
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit funny.
- Are the VPNs that Tom is talking about the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?

- Shoot a note to mkolon@hillvt.com if you have any questions, or just ask them in class.
