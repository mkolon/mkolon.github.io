title:  "December 4-6, 2023 - FDIC Deploying Internet and Intranet Firewalls"
---

Here's a [**link to the class materials**](https://class.hill.com/assets/FDIC-DIIF-2024.pptx) for this week.

### Monday December 4

- This page will host content and links for our December 4-6 DIIF class. Below is a taste of these...
- Here's [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- This is the [**the little problem**](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/02/ransomware_infection_credit_unions/) that the NCUA and scores of Credit Unions are dealing with right now (Dec 2-3). It might have been avoided entirely if credit unions and others [**had stayed on top of their software patching**](https://www.netscaler.com/blog/news/cve-2023-4966-critical-security-update-now-available-for-netscaler-adc-and-netscaler-gateway/).
- Here's a story about the [**GAO report**](https://fedscoop.com/financial-regulators-developing-and-tracking-fintech-skills-of-staff/) regarding technology training for the FDIC and other regulators.
- How many banks have you visited that have Cisco devices securing their internet connection? [**This little problem**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-10-000-cisco-devices-hacked-in-ios-xe-zero-day-attacks/) apparently only affects the Cisco OS version called IOS XE. You might add a check for that (and the patch) to your exam checklist.

### Tuesday December 5

- [**Cyberscoop**](https://cyberscoop.com/) is a great source of breaking news and other information about Cybersecurity, with an emphasis on the public sector. [**Today's headline story is directly relevant**](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-fbi-epa-water-unitronics/) to a topic that a few people raised in class yesterday around industrial control systems.
- What do you know about [the **Solar Winds** attack](https://www.cisecurity.org/solarwinds)? How might it affect your advice to banks on patching?
- For our "Find a Firewall" exercise:
  - [**Here's the topology**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/faf.png)
- And here are some links to the vendors:
  - [**Fortinet**](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)
  - [**Palo Alto**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware)
  - [**SonicWall**](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/)
  - [**Barracuda**](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/next-generation-security)
  - [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html#tabs-9e2187ae1d-item-4b92b35855-tab)
- You don't have to use these links, I'm providing them as shortcuts to what seem to be the best sources of information for the exercise. You can look for, research, and use any platform from your vendor that you think fits the need.

### Wednesday December 6

- [**Here's a link to a PDF of the topologies**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/diif_bank_topos.pptx) of the banks we'll use in the 2nd exercise we'll do on Wednesday.
- I mentioned [**a banking exploit of the SWIFT system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack) by a group known as APT38. Much of it is outside the scope of our class, but it's a wild story related to banks and shows how creative the bad guys can get.
- Here's a link to [**the Stuxnet movie** called Zero Days](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Days-Colonel-Gary-Brown/dp/B01I2C0UV6) that we discussed (it's on Amazon Prime). It proves you don't need network access to get malware into a system if you have USB drives and some creativity. A crazy story, well told. After watching it, do you want to ask banks to stop using USB drives?
- Here's [**SonicWall's live demo page**](https://sonicos.demo.sonicwall.com/sonicui/7/login/#/) that I used when talking about network monitoring via firewalls. It's just great that they provide this so folks like us can familarize ourselves with their interface and capabilities. Makes me want to buy from them!
- If you don't understand why perimeter-centric, firewall-based security is old and busted, and what banks need to do about it, [**please read this**](https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/zero-trust/definitions/what-is-zero-trust-network-access-ztna/) - it's just one of many good ZTNA explainers for mortals. If you're feeling super-human and you want more detail from a federal perspectective, [**please be my guest**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
- Interesting timing, but [**it seems 23andMe was just hacked**](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/05/23andme-hack-data-breach?ref=biztoc.com). I hope they don't release my cat's DNA data to the world!
- Maybe this one is just for the geeks, but some of you might remember I didn't know what one of the fields in the auth.log file I showed you was. The answer is that in the entry:
  `Dec  5 18:43:24 boingit sshd[409841]: Invalid user ak from 185.74.6.243 port 34650`
- the number 409841 is the process ID of sshd. Whew.
  
- Here's the answer from ChatGPT:
