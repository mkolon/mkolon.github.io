title:  "December 4-6, 2023 - FDIC Deploying Internet and Intranet Firewalls"
---

Here's a [**link to the class materials**](https://class.hill.com/assets/FDIC-DIIF-2024.pptx) for this week.

### Monday December 4

- This page will host content and links for our December 4-6 DIIF class. Below is a taste of these...
- Here's [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- This is the [**the little problem**](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/02/ransomware_infection_credit_unions/) that the NCUA and scores of Credit Unions are dealing with right now (Dec 2-3). It might have been avoided entirely if credit unions and others [**had stayed on top of their software patching**](https://www.netscaler.com/blog/news/cve-2023-4966-critical-security-update-now-available-for-netscaler-adc-and-netscaler-gateway/).
- Here's a story about the [**GAO report**](https://fedscoop.com/financial-regulators-developing-and-tracking-fintech-skills-of-staff/) regarding technology training for the FDIC and other regulators.
- How many banks have you visited that have Cisco devices securing their internet connection? [**This little problem**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-10-000-cisco-devices-hacked-in-ios-xe-zero-day-attacks/) apparently only affects the Cisco OS version called IOS XE. You might add a check for that (and the patch) to your exam checklist.

### Tuesday December 5

- [**Cyberscoop**](https://cyberscoop.com/) is a great source of breaking news and other information about Cybersecurity, with an emphasis on the public sector. [**Today's headline story is directly relevant**](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-fbi-epa-water-unitronics/) to a topic that a few people raised in class yesterday around industrial control systems.
- What do you know about [the **Solar Winds** attack](https://www.cisecurity.org/solarwinds)? How might it affect your advice to banks on patching?
- For our "Find a Firewall" exercise:
  - [**Here's the topology**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/faf.png)
- And here are some links to the vendors:
  - [**Fortinet**](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)
  - [**Palo Alto**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware)
  - [**SonicWall**](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/)
  - [**Barracuda**](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/next-generation-security)
  - [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html#tabs-9e2187ae1d-item-4b92b35855-tab)
- You don't have to use these links, I'm providing them as shortcuts to what seem to be the best sources of information for the exercise. You can look for, research, and use any platform from your vendor that you think fits the need.

### Wednesday December 6

- I mentioned [an exploit using the SWIFT banking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack) by a group known as APT38. Much of it is outside the scope of our class, but it's a wild story related to banks and shows how creative the bad guys can get.
- Here's a link to [the Stuxnet movie](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Days-Colonel-Gary-Brown/dp/B01I2C0UV6) that proves you don't need network access to get malware into a system if you have USB drives and some creativity. A crazy story, well told.
- Here's [SonicWall's live demo page](https://sonicos.demo.sonicwall.com/sonicui/7/login/#/) that I used when talking about network monitoring via firewalls. It's just great that they allow this so folks like us can familarize ourselves with their interface and capabilities. Makes me want to buy from them!
