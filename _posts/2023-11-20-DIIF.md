Here's a [**link to the class materials**](https://class.hill.com/assets/FDIC-DIIF-2024.pptx) for this week.

### Monday December 4

- This page will host content and links for our December 4-6 DIIF class. Below is a taste of these...
- Here's [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- This is the [**the little problem**](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/02/ransomware_infection_credit_unions/) that the NCUA and scores of Credit Unions are dealing with right now (Dec 2-3). It might have been avoided entirely if credit unions and others [**had stayed on top of their software patching**](https://www.netscaler.com/blog/news/cve-2023-4966-critical-security-update-now-available-for-netscaler-adc-and-netscaler-gateway/).
- Here's a story about the [**GAO report**](https://fedscoop.com/financial-regulators-developing-and-tracking-fintech-skills-of-staff/) regarding technology training for the FDIC and other regulators.
- How many banks have you visited that have Cisco devices securing their internet connection? [**This little problem**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-10-000-cisco-devices-hacked-in-ios-xe-zero-day-attacks/) apparently only affects the Cisco OS version called IOS XE. You might add a check for that (and the patch) to your exam checklist.

### Tuesday December 5

- What do you know about [the Solar Winds attack](https://www.cisecurity.org/solarwinds)? How might it affect your advice to banks on patching?
- For our "Find a Firewall" exercise:
  - [Here's the topology](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/faf.png)
- And here are some links to the vendors:
  - Fortinet
  - Palo Alto
  - SonicWall
  - Barracuda
  - Cisco
