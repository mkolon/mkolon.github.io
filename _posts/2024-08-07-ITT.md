This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/ITT-2024-03-24.pptx) for the week.

### Monday August 19

- If you enjoy history, you may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information in computers and online. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think his work influenced how banks work today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while. What might the networking consequences of this fact be, for security, availability, or other reasons?

- We briefly talked about insane data speeds. [**This article**](https://www.zmescience.com/science/scientists-set-new-world-record-for-data-transfer-at-1-8-petabits-per-second-thats-twice-the-global-internet-traffic/) is a couple years old, higher speeds are surely being contemplated by now. At some point it just gets silly to try and understand things happening at a speed like 1.8 petabits per second...

### Tuesday August 20

- Remember that there are basically only three MNOs (Mobile Network Operators) in the US - Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. All the other "Cellular providers" are actually not MNOs but MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) who use the networks of the big three. [**Here's a list**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_virtual_network_operators_in_the_United_States) of who uses whom. Note that sometimes an MVNO will use more than one MNO because it wants redundancy or extended geographic coverage.

- Ethernet is usually considered secure because it's used in controlled physical environments, but sometimes (especially in campus or large building deployments) both ends are not as well-controlled as you'd like. [**For situations like this there's MACsec**](https://nilesecure.com/network-security/what-is-macsec).

- Just so you can see what a tiny ISP looks like, I present to you my own lovely [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com). If you were my neighbor, I'd try to sell you our service. We're only $90/month for 1Gbps, what a deal! But is there any risk in a small bank using a startup ISP like this, and not, say, AT&T, Verizon, or Comcast?

### Wednesday August 21

- Here is [**a great article**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) about how TCP does its amazing job.

- I mentioned, but did not demonstrate, [**MOSH**](https://mosh.org/) (Mobile Shell), which is an SSH-type way of connecting to servers that uses TCP port 60001 and solves some of the problems SSH has with mobile (or otherwise wonky) connections.

- I positively **scoured** the internet looking for a copy of The Citi Never Sleeps jingle as I remember it. I failed, but I did find [**this advertisement from around the same time**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7OjDQyYoE). You can kind of hear the jingle in the background, and the jingle chorus comes in at the end. So now you know. 
- We don't have an offical list of networking acronyms or terms, but there are few decent ones online, for example:
    -  [**SANS**](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/)
    -  [**Global Knowledge**](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/topics/cybersecurity/glossary-of-terms/)
    -  And of course our lovely [**NIST**](https://www.nsi.org/pdf/reports/NIST%20Network%20Security%20Acronyms.pdf)

### Thursday August 22

- As far as I can find, Apple themselves haven't published much about **how** AirDrop works, but there are a few [**decent explanations**](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512#:~:text=How%20Does%20AirDrop%20Work%3F,to%20have%20an%20AirDrop%20connection.) online. As usual, a decent look into a rather obscure topic is available [**on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop)
- Want an example of a site that will never use secure HTTPS? Welcome to [**HTTP Forever!**](http://httpforever.com/).
- As we saw in class, here's the [**SSL Labs tool**](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) that lets you see how secure a bank's (or anyone's) website is.
- [**Hive Systems**](https://www.hivesystems.com) has password strength matrix and cybersecurity perceptions quick references that you may find interesting and useful.
- [**Let's Encrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a nonprofit Certificate Authority providing TLS certificates to 450 million websites, including the FDIC's! If you want to pay lots of money for more or less the same thing, you can use a company like [**Digicert**](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/certcentral-tls-ssl-manager). I shouldn't be so snarky, Digicert provides and manages many extra services around digital trust that have real value.
- We only briefly talked about [**Passkeys**](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/), but they will probably replace most passwords before too long. The consortium promulating them is [**the FIDO Alliance**](https://fidoalliance.org/), and there's lots of good info on their site about the passkey initiative.
- The Verizon [**Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) is a great resource to help you know about what threats are out there.

### Friday August 23

- Here are a couple of docs I've dreamed up over the years that you could find useful. A [**list of controls**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Controls.docx) and [**one of documentation**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Docs.docx) that might be useful in considering bank VPN and Remote Access implementations (and plenty of other things). **These are not official FDIC documents**, just my slightly informed thinking.
- Books for your consideration
    - [**The Age of Survelliance Capitalism**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-the-fight-for-a-human-future-at-the-new-frontier-of-power-shoshana-zuboff/9240225?ean=9781541758001)
    - [**Privacy is Power**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/privacy-is-power-why-and-how-you-should-take-back-control-of-your-data-carissa-veliz/15315465?ean=9781612199672)
    - [**The Cyber Effect**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-cyber-effect-an-expert-in-cyberpsychology-explains-how-technology-is-shaping-our-children-our-behavior-and-our-values-and-what-w-mary-aiken/11742110?ean=9780812987478)
    - The [**Electronic Frontier Foundation**](https://www.eff.org/) - not a book, but worth your time and consideration if you care about stuff like this.
