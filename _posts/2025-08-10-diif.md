title:  "August 25-27, 2025 - FDIC Deploying Internet and Intranet Firewalls"

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment, and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

**In case of an extended interruption to the class Teams session, return here for notes on getting back into the session.**

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-DIIF-2025-08-18.pptx) for the week.


### Monday August 25

- If there's anything examiners know, it's that having a plan is important. It's good to learn that [**Microsoft knows this too**](https://cyberscoop.com/microsoft-threat-intel-response-tips/).
- Here's another [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- Don sent along [**this neat article**](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2025/the-reality-of-ai-oversold-and-underdelivered) from ISACA about the confusing state of AI and it's relationship to IT trust.
- We looked at [**What is my IP?**](https://www.whatismyip.com/) which is a great site for innocently poking around your personal IP address space.
- It's not particularly user-friendly, but here's [**the NMAP application**](https://nmap.org/) I showed you today. There are many other, more capable network port scanners out there; I like **nmap** because its output is clear and easy to read.
- I told you not to worry about DHCP attacks. Maybe I [**spoke too soon**](https://www.ipvanish.com/blog/tunnelvision-vpn-vulnerability/).
- If you don't understand why perimeter-centric, firewall-only security is old and busted, and what banks need to do about it, [**please read this**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/) - it's just one of many good ZTNA explainers for mortals (Okay, it's from CrowdStrike, but that's probably okay, they're good folks.) If you're feeling super-human and you want more detail from a federal perspectective, [**please be my guest**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
- We had to blow past it pretty fast today, so here is [**a great article**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) about how TCP does its amazing job.
