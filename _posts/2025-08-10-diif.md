title:  "August 25-27, 2025 - FDIC Deploying Internet and Intranet Firewalls"

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment, and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

**In case of an extended interruption to the class Teams session, return here for notes on getting back into the session.**

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-DIIF-2025-08-18.pptx) for the week.


### Monday August 25

- If there's anything examiners know, it's that having a plan is important. It's good to learn that [**Microsoft knows this too**](https://cyberscoop.com/microsoft-threat-intel-response-tips/).
- Here's another [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- Don sent along [**this neat article**](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2025/the-reality-of-ai-oversold-and-underdelivered) from ISACA about the confusing state of AI and its relationship to IT trust.
- We looked at [**What is my IP?**](https://www.whatismyip.com/) which is a great site for innocently poking around your personal IP address space.
- It's not particularly user-friendly, but here's [**the NMAP application**](https://nmap.org/) I showed you today. There are many other, more capable network port scanners out there; I like **nmap** because its output is clear and easy to read.
- I told you not to worry about DHCP attacks. Maybe I [**spoke too soon**](https://www.ipvanish.com/blog/tunnelvision-vpn-vulnerability/).
- If you don't understand why perimeter-centric, firewall-only security is old and busted, and what banks need to do about it, [**please read this**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/) - it's just one of many good ZTNA explainers for mortals (Okay, it's from CrowdStrike, but that's probably okay, they're good folks.) If you're feeling super-human and you want more detail from a federal perspectective, [**please be my guest**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
- We had to blow past it pretty quickly today, so here is [**a great article**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) about how TCP does its amazing job.

### Tuesday August 26

- Bouncing off today's first exercise, here are some ideas for [**questions about firewalls and network security**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Firewall-question-ideas.docx) that might help you to develop or tighten up your own.
- As we've noted, firewalls are far from the final word on network security these days. [**Here's a decent article from SentinelOne**](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/xdr/understanding-the-difference-between-edr-siem-soar-and-xdr/) about some more advanced approaches and what they bring to the table.
- For our "Find a Firewall" exercise:
  - [**Here's the topology**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/faf.png)
- And here are some links to the vendors:
  - [**Fortinet**](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)
  - [**Palo Alto**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware)
  - [**SonicWall**](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/)
  - [**Barracuda**](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/next-generation-security)
  - [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html)
- You don't have to use these links, I'm providing them as shortcuts to what seem to be the best sources of information for the exercise. You can look for, research, and use any platform from your vendor that you think fits the need.
- This is not brand-new, but it's [**a good list of network risks**](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2024/02/seven-cybersecurity-threats-for-banks-in-2024-and-some-smart-precautions/) for banks and related companies.
- Fortinet has a similar list that's [**focused on solutions they provide**](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/financial-services/types-of-cyberattacks-on-financial-institutions), but hey, I guess you can't blame them for that. 
- This is the [**Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/). I'm not shilling for Verizon, but it is an awesome resource, updated yearly, and it's free if you register to read it. I would read it!

### Wednesday August 27

- As you saw in yesterday's exercise, firewalls can do lots of different things these days. Here's a list of some ways [**firewalls can serve as network security**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Firewall-Controls.docx) controls.
