This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

You might add a check for that (and the patch) to your exam checklist.
- As we will see, firewalls and other security elements are themselves [**continually under attack**](https://www.databreachtoday.com/cisco-fixes-firewall-0-days-after-likely-nation-state-hack-a-24934). This is just one recent example that could compromise community banks given the type of device targeted. 
- Here's another [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
