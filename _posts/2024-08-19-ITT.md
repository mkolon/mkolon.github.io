title:  "March 24-29, 2024 - FDIC Introduction to Telecommunications and Networking"

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/ITT-2024-03-24.pptx) for the week.

### Monday March 25

- If you enjoy history, you may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information in computers and online. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think his work influenced how banks work today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while. What might the networking consequences of this fact be, for security, availability, or other reasons?

### Tuesday March 26

- The DoD sure had (has?) a hard time figuring out how to award cloud contracts. From [**JEDI**](https://fedscoop.com/pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract-dod-military-industry-day/) to [**JWCC**](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/08/joint_warfighting_cloud_capability_awarded/) to [**JADC2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_All-Domain_Command_and_Control#JWCC). Let's hope that when the Fed or FDIC wants a similar capability, they will handle it more smoothly. But it's a huge and difficult problem.
  
- I mentioned that [**FedRAMP**](https://www.fedramp.gov/) is the program that certifies cloud service offerings are compliant with security requirements as outlined by the federal government. There are already [**over 300 services in their marketplace**](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products) and ready to be used by federal agencies, or anyone who wants to meet such standards, whether required to or not.

- We briefly talked about insane data speeds. [**This article**](https://www.zmescience.com/science/scientists-set-new-world-record-for-data-transfer-at-1-8-petabits-per-second-thats-twice-the-global-internet-traffic/) is a couple years old, things are surely even faster now. At some point it just gets silly to try and understand things happening at a speed like 1.8 petabits per second...

- Here's the homepage of my little ISP in Northern Vermont: [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com). Is there any risk in a small bank using a startup ISP like this, and not, say, AT&T, Verizon, or Comcast?

### Wednesday March 27

- Not networking, but in case you're wondering where the [**April 8 Solar Eclipse**](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2024-april-8) will be best seen, this is a pretty good link for you.

- [**Cradlepoint**](https://cradlepoint.com/) does lots of stuff now, but they got their start making [**cellular failover devices and services**](https://cradlepoint.com/products/branch/branch-continuity/) for bank branches and others that needed better uptime then they could get from their fixed internet service alone.

- Here's a link to [**the Stuxnet movie** called Zero Days](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Days-Colonel-Gary-Brown/dp/B01I2C0UV6) that we discussed (it's on Amazon Prime). It proves you don't need network access to get malware into a system if you have USB drives and some creativity. A crazy espionage story, well told. 

- We discussed the [**size of the internet routing table**](https://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/), that is, the number of routes in the backbone of the internet. It's big, but maybe smaller than you'd think for a network with ~4.3B endpoints. Why might that be?

- Here's the [**Network-wide Risk Assessment Document**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Don's_Network-Wide_Risk_Assessment.xlsx) that Don shared at the start of class this morning.

- Here is [**a great article**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) about how TCP does its amazing job.

- Two views of the importance of DNS security best practices. One from [**Webroot**](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/dns-security-best-practices), the other from [**the InfoSec Institute**](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/dns-security-best-practices-preventing-dns-hijacking-poisoning-and-redirection/).

- Here's a clear and simple discussion of some aspects of [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) from Cloudflare. In fact, if you mouse around a bit on that page, you'll find many good explainers for various aspects of cybersecurity.

### Thursday March 28

#### Router/firewall selection exercise, by table number:
1. [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/industries/financial-services.html)
2. [**Fortinet**](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)
3. [**SonicWall**](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/entry-level/)
4. [**Palo Alto**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware)
5. [**Ubiquiti**](https://ui.com/us/en/cloud-gateways/large-scale)
   
- This is the [**Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/). I'm not shilling for Verizon, but it is an awesome resource, updated yearly, and it's free if you register to read it. I would read it.

### Friday March 29

- The [**SEC Complaint against SolarWinds**](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-227.pdf) makes for crazy reading. It's almost a perfect list of what not to do regarding cybersecurity and compliance. Bill, thanks for the link!
