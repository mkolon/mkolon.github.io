This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-ITT-20250627.pptx) for the week.

### Monday October 20

- If you enjoy history, you may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information in computers and online. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. Now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think his work influenced how banks work today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while. What might the networking consequences of this fact be, for security, availability, or other reasons?

### Tuesday October 21

- [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/) is a great way to know if it's you or them that's having problems.

- Yesterday's [AWS Outage](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) was bad. It will probably take a couple of days to know exactly how bad, but in the meantime there's plenty of speculation from outfits like [El Reg](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/amazon_aws_outage/?td=rt-3a), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/what-that-huge-aws-outage-reveals-about-the-internet/), and [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/tech/how-the-aws-outage-happened-and-why-its-breaking-the-internet).
