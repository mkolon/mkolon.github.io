This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. **It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading.** But as we move through the week, I'll post links related to class topics, assignments, and other interesting nuggets.

### Monday July 13

- Just to whet your whistle, [**Here's an interesting story**](https://www.fortra.com/blog/safepay-ransomware-what-you-need-know) about Safepay Ransomware, one of the scarier and more active ransomware groups in current activity. The question for us is: *How could a small bank protect themselves against a crew like this?* 

- Despite the sunsetting of the CAT, there are still great resources to guide banks (and you) when thinking about Cybersecurity. One is the [**FFIEC Cybersecurity Awareness**](https://www.ffiec.gov/resources/cybersecurity-awareness) website, another is the [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.) we've talked about the last couple days. 

- The Verizon [**Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) is a great resource to help you know about what threats are out there. [**Crowdstrike**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/) also has something similar.

- It's a little old, but this is [**great article on the need for post-quantum cryptography**](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3498776/post-quantum-cryptography-cisa-nist-and-nsa-recommend-how-to-prepare-now/). 

- To tell the truth, the awesome world in which [**we don't need username/password combos**](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) is taking a long time to arrive. I'm not sure who to blame, but this guy [**has some ideas**](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-troubleshooting-solutions). It's a technical article, but worth skimming the headlines.

- If a bank hasn't deployed MFA yet, they're not getting the message. Here's one [**way to convince**](https://www.covrsecurity.com/three-simple-advice-to-convince-your-users-of-the-benefits-of-mfa/) and [**here's another**](https://saasalerts.com/the-case-for-mfa-implementation/). Once you've done that, you can convince them to [**stop using SMS**](https://cyberessentials.substack.com/p/should-you-stop-using-sms-in-mfa) as the 2nd factor... Good luck!
