title: "July 13-17, 2025 - FDIC Introduction to Security"
---

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. **It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading.** But as we move through the week, I'll post links related to class topics, assignments, and other interesting nuggets.

- Here's a link to the [**updated Powerpoint deck**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Intro-security.pptx).

### Monday July 13

- Just to whet your whistle, [**Here's an interesting story**](https://www.fortra.com/blog/safepay-ransomware-what-you-need-know) about Safepay Ransomware, one of the scarier and more active ransomware groups in current activity. The question for us is: *How could a small bank protect themselves against a crew like this?* 

- Despite the sunsetting of the CAT, there are still great resources to guide banks (and you) when thinking about Cybersecurity. One is the [**FFIEC Cybersecurity Awareness**](https://www.ffiec.gov/resources/cybersecurity-awareness) website, another is the [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1301.pdf) we've talked about the last couple days. The link goes to the quick start guide. 

- The Verizon [**Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) is a great resource to help you know about what threats are out there. [**Crowdstrike**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/) also has something similar.

- It's a little old, but this is [**great article on the need for post-quantum cryptography**](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3498776/post-quantum-cryptography-cisa-nist-and-nsa-recommend-how-to-prepare-now/). 

- To tell the truth, the awesome world in which [**we don't need username/password combos**](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) is taking a long time to arrive. I'm not sure who to blame, but this guy [**has some ideas**](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-troubleshooting-solutions). It's a technical article, but worth skimming the headlines.

- If a bank hasn't deployed MFA yet, they're not getting the message. Here's one [**way to convince**](https://www.covrsecurity.com/three-simple-advice-to-convince-your-users-of-the-benefits-of-mfa/) and [**here's another**](https://saasalerts.com/the-case-for-mfa-implementation/). Once you've done that, you can convince them to [**stop using SMS**](https://cyberessentials.substack.com/p/should-you-stop-using-sms-in-mfa) as the 2nd factor... Good luck! 

#### Some of the contents of my "daily" folder 
- [**CyberScoop**](https://cyberscoop.com/) - general-purpose cyber news
- [**SDX Central**](https://www.sdxcentral.com/) - good moderately-technical rundown of current events in the SD Networking world
- [**The Register**](https://www.theregister.com/) - cheeky British security writing
- [**Krebs on Security**](https://krebsonsecurity.com/) - Brian Krebs' in-depth reporting on security issues
- [**Schneier on Security**](https://www.schneier.com/) - Bruce Schneier is a legend. His site goes deep. He likes squids, too.
- [**Data Breach Today**](https://www.databreachtoday.com/) - what bad things happened yesterday
- [**Bleeping Computer**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/) - consumer (client) focus on computer problems

### Tuesday July 14

- I mentioned that I am involved with a tiny fiber ISP called [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com) here in Northern Vermont. Broadband to the people!

- Cryptography is hard, but it’s less hard when it’s filled with adorable Japanese manga. Check out the [**Manga Guide to Cryptography**](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Cryptography-Guides/dp/1593277423/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=manga+crypto&qid=1671396861&sr=8-1), it's crazy fun and actually technically pretty deep!

- Salt Security has a good [**API Security Explainer**](https://salt.security/api-security-101) for beginners, it's very worth a look.

- Nobody needs [**19 Ways to Build Zero Trust Architectures**](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/06/nist-offers-19-ways-build-zero-trust-architectures), but this is still a good guide to the overall idea, with useful links to learn more. Also, a quick google of the term "Zero Trust" will yield about a million companies eager to help you by selling you stuff. [Some of these](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/the-essential-guide-to-zero-trust.html?device=c&_bt=71331022744964&_bm=e&msclkid=b65822b36cc9185914744ac5eff6780e) are pretty good (of course you must give up an email), others, less so. Also, I don't know who these folks are but at first glance I like their [**ZTA Cheat Sheet**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Zero_Trust_Architecture_Cheat_Sheet.html).

- Speaking of physical security, here's a link to [**the Stuxnet movie** called Zero Days](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Days-Colonel-Gary-Brown/dp/B01I2C0UV6) that we discussed (it's on Amazon Prime). It proves you don't need network access to get malware into a system if you have USB drives and some creativity. A crazy espionage story.

- Mat (sic) Honan got hacked, but he says [**it wasn't all his fault**](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/). Actually, he does fess up in the text, just not the headline.

- Cryptocurrency is way beyond our remit this week, but fair winds are blowing, and banks will get involved. You should understand at least a bit about it, but it's complicated and filled with shysters. Here are a few resources to begin getting up to speed:

  - [**An explainer from the ubiquitous Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cryptocurrency)
  - This company has a [**silly name**](https://www.tastycrypto.com/basics/cryptocurrency-for-beginners/), but I kinda like their explanation of the tech.
  - I have never loved the "for dummies" idea, but this [**Introduction and Overview**](https://www.cloudwards.net/crypto-for-dummies/) of how it works from Cloudwards is pretty good.

### Wednesday July 15

- I briefly discussed [**Chokepoints**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/chokepoints-american-power-in-the-age-of-economic-warfare-edward-fishman/21504653?ean=9780593712979&next=t), by Edward Fishman, with Unique, and thought it might have resonance with others as well - particularly those interested in the application of finance to American power overseas.

- Don't forget [**HTTP forever**](http://httpforever.com/), perhaps the only site that will never be secure.

- Cloudflare has a great explainer on [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) and some other crypto things.

- Max mentioned [**Fintech Weekly**](https://www.fintechweekly.com/), a site that I hadn't heard of before. Gotta say it looks interesting.

- If you're interested Mike's story from this morning, I'm guessing that the bank is likely using one of the pieces of mining software [**described in thie Forbes article**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-mining-software/). Make sure you read the part at the bottom about investments in hardware and power, and the section titled "How Profitable Is Bitcoin Mining?" Not for the faint of heart...

### Thursday July 16

- We talked a bit about password managers. I use [**1Password**](https://1password.com/) and think they're pretty good, and are only $36/yr for individuals, $60/yr for a "family" of 5. There are many others a quick Google away, so look for yourself - but [**be careful**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lastpass-hacked/). Honestly though - while that's an awful story, you really should do better than Notes or Notepad for this.

- Here's that [**Spectrum MNE video**](https://boingit.com/MNE10.mp4) in case you want another look at that.

- You can play with routers, firewalls, and lots more at the [**Sonicwall Live Demo site**](https://livedemo.sonicwall.com/).

### Friday July 17

- [**MSSP Exercise**]

  - Table 1: [**SBS Cybersecurity**](https://sbscyber.com/)
  - Table 2: [**Arraya Solutions**](https://www.arrayasolutions.com/)
  - Table 3: [**Palo Alto Unit 42**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42)
  - Table 4: [**Optiv**](https://www.optiv.com/)
  - Table 5: [**SilverSky**](https://www.silversky.com/)

- Remember SSL Labs and their [**SSL Server Test**](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) page. You can use it to test any server to see how secure it is! A great, free service that anyone can use, even if you're not a geek.
