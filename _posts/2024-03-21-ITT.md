This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/ITT-2024-03-24.pptx) for the week.

### Monday March 25

- If you enjoy history, you may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information in computers and online. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think his work influenced how banks work today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while. What might the networking consequences of this fact be, for security, availability, or other reasons?

### Tuesday March 26

- The DoD sure had (has?) a hard time figuring out how to award cloud contracts. From [**JEDI**](https://fedscoop.com/pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract-dod-military-industry-day/) to [**JWCC**](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/08/joint_warfighting_cloud_capability_awarded/) to [**JADC2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_All-Domain_Command_and_Control#JWCC). Let's hope that when the Fed or FDIC wants a similar capability, they will handle it more smoothly. But it's a huge and difficult problem.
  
- I mentioned that [**FedRAMP**](https://www.fedramp.gov/) is the program that certifies cloud service offerings are compliant with security requirements as outlined by the federal government. There are already [**over 300 services in their marketplace**](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products) and ready to be used by federal agencies, or anyone who wants to meet such standards, whether required to or not.

- We briefly talked about insane data speeds. [**This article**](https://www.zmescience.com/science/scientists-set-new-world-record-for-data-transfer-at-1-8-petabits-per-second-thats-twice-the-global-internet-traffic/) is a couple years old, things are surely even faster now. At some point it just gets silly to try and understand things happening at a speed like 1.8 petabits per second...

- Here's the homepage of my little ISP in Northern Vermont: [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com). Is there any risk in a small bank using a startup ISP like this, and not, say, AT&T, Verizon, or Comcast?
