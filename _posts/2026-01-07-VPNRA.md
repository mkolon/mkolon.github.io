- My email is matt@hillvt.com, and you can call or text me on 8028990704. Contact me anytime with questions or for help.
- You can get the [**latest copy of the course materials**](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20260110.pptx) here, there won't be many changes but why not have the latest, right?

- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs that Tom is talking about the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [**the FFIEC has to say about remote access**](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Here's a [**"Magic VPN Box" animation**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) of the slides I ran through in class. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model operations, or just want a demonstration of what tunneling is.

- Mark F passed along this Jimmy Kimmel segment on [**getting people to cough up their passwords**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opRMrEfAIiI).

- And Brad wanted us to see [**this interesting story of a startup ISP**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/how-a-group-of-neighbors-created-their-own-internet-service/) in the Northwest (which happens to look a bit like my own beloved [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com/)).

- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only discovered last year. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."

- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.

- Crowdstrike has a good primer on the [basics of Zero Trust Architectures](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/).

- Cryptography is hard, but it’s less hard when it’s filled with adorable Japanese manga. Check out this [**Manga Guide to Cryptography**](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Cryptography-Guides/dp/1593277423/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=manga+crypto&qid=1671396861&sr=8-1), it's crazy and actually technically pretty deep! Maybe you need a gift for that millenial crypto-geek on your shopping list?

- The FIDO alliance has [improved their site](https://fidoalliance.org/), which now does a decent job of [explaining how passkeys work](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/).

- They're a vendor, but that doesn't make them evil. [This explainer from Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-dns-security) about DNS security is a good cheat sheet and jumping-off point for further study.

- Here's another [**Great Explainer from the EFF**](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you) on how to choose a VPN, depending on your needs and requirements. There's also some basic refresher stuff in there.

- Brad mentioned that Apple iMessage (their IP-based messaging client) has [**some privacy enhancements available**](https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-advanced-data-protection-works-and-how-to-turn-it-on/), this is some of what's up with that.
