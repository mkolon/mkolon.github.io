- My email is matt@hillvt.com, and you can call or text me on 8028990704. Contact me anytime with questions or for help.
- You can get the [**latest copy of the course materials**](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20260110.pptx) here, there won't be many changes but why not have the latest, right?

### Monday, Jan 12, 2026
- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs that Tom is talking about the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [**the FFIEC has to say about remote access**](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Here's a [**"Magic VPN Box" animation**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) of the slides I ran through in class. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model operations, or justwant a demonstration of what tunnling is.

- Mark F passed along this Jimmy Kimmel segment on [**getting people to cough up their passwords**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opRMrEfAIiI).

- And Brad wanted us to see [**this interesting story of a startup ISP**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/how-a-group-of-neighbors-created-their-own-internet-service/) in the Northwest (which happens to look a bit like my own beloved [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com/.))
