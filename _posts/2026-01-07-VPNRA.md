title:  "January 12: FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"

- My email is matt@hillvt.com, and you can call or text me on 8028990704. Contact me anytime with questions or for help.
- You can get the [**latest copy of the course materials**](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20260110.pptx) here, there won't be many changes but why not have the latest, right?

- Have a [**look at this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) if you can. It's only 8 minutes long. It's even a bit amusing.
  
- Are the VPNs that Tom is talking about the same as the ones we're going to discuss in class? Do banks use them? Are there differences and/or similarities?
  
- Here's what [**the FFIEC has to say about remote access**](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/information-security/ii-information-security-program-management/iic-risk-mitigation/iic15-logical-security/iic15-c-remote-access/) and to a lesser extent about VPNs specifically. To what extent does this match what you see in banks?

- Here's a [**"Magic VPN Box" animation**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) of the slides I ran through in class. You might find it useful if you're not completely conversant in OSI reference model operations, or just want a demonstration of what tunneling is.

- Mark F passed along this Jimmy Kimmel segment on [**getting people to cough up their passwords**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opRMrEfAIiI).

- And Brad wanted us to see [**this interesting story of a startup ISP**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/how-a-group-of-neighbors-created-their-own-internet-service/) in the Northwest (which happens to look a bit like my own beloved [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com/)).

- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only discovered last year. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."

- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.

- Crowdstrike has a good primer on the [basics of Zero Trust Architectures](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/).

- Cryptography is hard, but it’s less hard when it’s filled with adorable Japanese manga. Check out this [**Manga Guide to Cryptography**](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Cryptography-Guides/dp/1593277423/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=manga+crypto&qid=1671396861&sr=8-1), it's crazy and actually technically pretty deep! Maybe you need a gift for that millenial crypto-geek on your shopping list?

- The FIDO alliance has [improved their site](https://fidoalliance.org/), which now does a decent job of [explaining how passkeys work](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/).

- They're a vendor, but that doesn't make them evil. [This explainer from Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-dns-security) about DNS security is a good cheat sheet and jumping-off point for further study.

- Here's another [**Great Explainer from the EFF**](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you) on how to choose a VPN, depending on your needs and requirements. There's also some basic refresher stuff in there.

- Brad mentioned that Apple iMessage (their IP-based messaging client) has [**some privacy enhancements available**](https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-advanced-data-protection-works-and-how-to-turn-it-on/), this is some of what's up with that.

- There are many, many online treatments of cryptography topics. Here are a few decent ones:
  - [**Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/asymmetric-vs-symmetric-encryption/)
  - [**Public Key Infrastructure**](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/public-key-infrastructure)
  - I must admit I love Cloudflare. Explainers like these, on [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) and [**SSL Certificates**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/), are a big part of why I feel that way.

- Brad also shared [**this article**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602) about another Apple security enhancement called iCloud Private Relay. [**Here's another view**](https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/25/should-you-use-icloud-private-relay-heres-how-it-works/) (not from Apple) that goes a little deeper. As Brad said when he sent me the article, it seems this service "connects users to two relays, one can see your ip address, but not where you are going, the next can see where you are going, but not your IP address." Interesting and perhaps useful if you fit the use profile, but not a VPN.

- Here's [some intel from purewl](https://www.purewl.com/vpn-vulnerabilities-you-should-know-about/) about VPN vulnerabilities. There's a bit of scaremongering because they're a security vendor, but it's interesting nonetheless.


- I accidentally ran into this guide on [**Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions**](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Sep/28/2002863184/-1/-1/0/CSI_SELECTING-HARDENING-REMOTE-ACCESS-VPNS-20210928.PDF) while looking for something else. Honest I did! It's a few years old, but then again it's from the NSA, so it's pretty good, too.

- Here are a couple of docs we've dreamed up over the years that you could find useful. A [**list of controls**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Controls.docx) and [**one of documentation**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Docs.docx) that might be useful in considering bank VPN and Remote Access implementations. **These are not official FDIC documents**, just my slightly informed thinking.

- Here's a shot at making a [**Remote Access Risk Assessment**](http://class.hillvt.com/assets/Remote_Access_Risk_Assessment.pdf). What do you think of this? Is it useful, perhaps as the start of something you might make yourself?

- You can't do anything today without encountering an Artificial Intelligence angle, and [**VPNs are no exception**](https://medium.com/@44dying/the-impact-of-ai-on-vpn-security-predictive-threat-detection-and-response-d371a34c71c0). We may not see [**AI doing its work in the VPN context**](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-ai-work-in-vpns/), but that doesn't mean VPN and networking companies aren't using it. What could that look like for banks?
