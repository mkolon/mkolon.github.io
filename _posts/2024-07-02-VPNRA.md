title:  "July 15, 2024 - FDIC VPNs and Remote Access"
---

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-VPNRA-20240716.pptx) for the week.

### Monday July 15

- VPN vendors do a lot of marketing. What do you think of [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY)?
- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only widely publicised a couple of months ago. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."
- You might not be safe with [**Remote access apps**](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/teamviewer_network_breach/?td=keepreading) either.

### Tuesday July 16

- [**Forbes thinks you should**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/vpn-uses/) use a VPN for your online finance. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with who advertises on their site! Maybe I'm being sarcastic here, you decide, especially after you read the next article...
- On the other hand [**Brian X. Chen of the New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/technology/personaltech/are-vpns-worth-it.html?searchResultPosition=1) thinks VPNs are a waste of time and money. (This article is behind a paywall, so if you can't get to it, Google "VPNs are a scam" and we can discuss it if we need to.
- I know you're already experts, but it can't hurt to get [**a refresher on GLBA and privacy**](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-glba-compliance-understanding-data-protection-requirements-gramm-leach-bliley-act).
- Anthony mentioned yesterday that regulations aren't as ancient as it sometimes seems, at least with regard to GLBA. The [**Safeguards Rule**](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/05/safeguards-rule-notification-requirement-now-effect) is quite new, and does a lot to update what businesses must do to protect nonpublic private information.
- The idea of tunnelling is fundamental to VPN operation. Here's a link to an animated version of my little [**Magic VPN Box**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-vpn/MagicVPNs.mp4) explainer from yesterday, if you want to be able to re-watch it. 
- Finally, another [**Great Explainer from the EFF**](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you) on how to choose a VPN, depending on your needs and requirements.
- Here are a couple of docs I've dreamed up over the years that you could find useful. A [**list of controls**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Controls.docx) and [**one of documentation**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/VPNRA-Docs.docx) that might be useful in considering bank VPN and Remote Access implementations. **These are not official FDIC documents**, just my slightly informed thinking.
