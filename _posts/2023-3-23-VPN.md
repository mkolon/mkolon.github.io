title:  "March 27-29, 2023 - FDIC VPN & RA"
---

Welcome to our class on VPNs and Remote access for the FDIC and other financial examiners. Here are are a few things to get you thinking about topics we'll cover during the week:

- A [**running list**](/assets/VPN_questions.html) of questions about VPNs and related topics that I might ask if I were an examiner of banks. Since I'm a network geek, these are ones related to this class - there are certainly other good ones.

### Monday March 27th

- We'll talk about VPN topics in class of course, but an entertaining introduction to some of them [**can be found in this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) by [Tom Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Scott_(presenter)).

- You certainly already appreciate the role privacy plays in the financial sector. The [**Electronic Frontier Foundation**](https://www.eff.org/) has a longstanding relationship to issues related to privacy - which is, after all, the "P" in VPN. [**Their most recent update**](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/mailing/view?reset=1&id=11829) will give you a sense of how "privacy first" technologists and activists think, and also provides links to many VPN-adjacent resources.

- **The Economist's** 2021 book of the year - [Privacy is Power](https://bookshop.org/p/books/privacy-is-power-why-and-how-you-should-take-back-control-of-your-data-carissa-veliz/15315465?ean=9781612199672) by Carissa Véliz.

### Tuesday March 28th

- Yesterday I mentioned the OG of Internet Privacy herself, [**Shoshanna Zuboff**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff), but neglected to link to her [**magnum opus**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-the-fight-for-a-human-future-at-the-new-frontier-of-power-shoshana-zuboff/9240225?ean=9781541758001). Carissa Véliz certainly read this book.

- **Incognito Mode** on a web browser is a great way to keep what you're doing away from prying eyes on your (or a shared) computer, but it doesn't do anything to keep remote people from seeing what you're doing. Here are a couple decent articles about this, one from [Avast](https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-incognito-mode
) and one from [Bitcatcha](https://www.bitcatcha.com/blog/can-wifi-owner-see-what-sites-visited-incognito/). 

- Yesterday I talked through the "Magic VPNs" example in the book, but here's an [**animated recording**](/assets/MagicVPNs.mp4) of the same material that you can replay if you'd like.

- The relationship between VPNs and ZTNA depends on who's solution you're talking about. [This article from TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/versus/ztna-vs-vpn-what-are-the-differences) does a decent job of explaining it without too much company marketing.

### Wednesday March 29th

- I must admit I love Cloudflare. Explainers like these, on [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) and [**SSL Certificates**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/), are a big part of why I feel that way.

- In case you wanted a bit more detail on [**how AES encryption works**](https://proprivacy.com/guides/aes-encryption).

- You can say this is a bit silly, but...well, it's just awesome. [**The Manga Guide to Cryptography**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-manga-guide-to-cryptography-masaaki-mitani/7918583?ean=9781593277420)! I got a copy for Christmas, honest.

- Christian asked a great question about how *exactly* the remote login I demonstrated works - there's more to it than I thought! The answer (to a reasonable degree of detail) is located in the [**Unix man pages**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html#AUTHENTICATION), like all good geeky answers.

- Thanks to Paul for sending me a (rather unhinged, and on TikTok too!) video monologue from some dude hyperventilating about the RESTRICT act. I can't say I liked his style, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. Here are some other points along similar lines:

  - [Internet Governance](https://www.internetgovernance.org/2023/03/13/the-restrict-act-reversing-globalization-in-ict/) calls it "the latest legislative atrocity to emerge from Washington."
  - [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/two-new-bills-tiktok-and-beyond-data-act-and-restrict-act) also talks a bit about the DATA act.
  - [My lovely EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/government-hasnt-justified-tiktok-ban) doesn't care about TikTok much itself, rather points out that RESTRICT is just bad law.


I'm not saying you should contact your reps about this bill, but...

- We probably didn't talk about Remote Access Trojans (RATs) enough, so here's [a good article](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/remote-access-trojan) from Fortinet on the topic.
