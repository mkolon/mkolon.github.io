This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. **It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading.** But as we move through the week, I'll post links related to class topics, assignments, and other interesting nuggets.

- Here's the [**class Powerpoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/FDIC-ITT-20250627.pptx) for the week.

### Monday December 1

- What do you know about [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/)? They are one of the (mostly) hidden heroes of the modern internet, and are critical to the smooth functioning of many services you and small banks use every day. But last week [**they had a big problem**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/cloudflare-blames-this-weeks-massive-outage-on-database-issues/), one a a few lately. How well does that article explain what happened?

- You may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material. And where do you think Anthropic [**got the name for their AI**](https://claude.ai/new)? (If you're on an FDIC or State computer, that last link may be broken, sorry. We'll talk about why in class...)

- If you're bored by history, that's a shame, but just know that Claude S is the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary in 1948. There – now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think Shannon's work influenced how banks operate today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. **What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate?** Could that happen?

- Here's the homepage of my little ISP in Northern Vermont: [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com). Is there any risk in a small bank using a startup ISP like this, and not, say, AT&T, Verizon, or Comcast?

-  A crazy story of [**AI Deepfaking being used for fraud**](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk) by faking the voices and presences of executives. The worker who transferred the money "put aside his early doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized." Whoa.

### Tuesday December 2

- Gah, sorry, I forgot about **T-Mobile** at the end of class on Monday! Remember that there are basically only **three** MNOs (Mobile Network Operators) in the US - Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. All the other "Cellular providers" are actually not MNOs but MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) who use the networks of the big three. [**Here's a list**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_virtual_network_operators_in_the_United_States) of who uses whom. Note that sometimes an MVNO will use more than one MNO because it wants redundancy or extended geographic coverage.

- Ethernet is usually considered secure because it's used in controlled physical environments, but sometimes (especially in campus or large building deployments) both ends are not as well-controlled as you'd like. [**For situations like this there's MACsec**](https://nilesecure.com/network-security/what-is-macsec).
