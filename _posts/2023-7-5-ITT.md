title:  "July 31 - August 4, 2023 - FDIC Introduction to Telecommunications and Networking"
---
Welcome to our class on Telecommunications for FDIC and other financial examiners. 

Telecommunications and Networking are at the heart of modern banking systems. Today, banking services are accessed by customers anywhere, at any time, using a variety of devices.  Banking applications may be implemented in-house or by a service provider, but all need networks to function. 

Before class each day, I'll put links to things we've talked about and other items of interest on this page. There is no requirement to view or otherwise use them, but I hope you find some interesting or useful, and I will lead a discussion on them at the start of class each morning.

### Monday July 31

- If you enjoy history, [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) was the genius who enabled modern data communications. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- On the other hand, if you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**bits would be the things we'd use**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information online. It might seem obvious now, but it was pretty revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious documentary!

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while.

### Tuesday August 1

- I mentioned that I am involved with a tiny fiber ISP called [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com) here in Northern Vermont. Broadband to the people!

- We briefly discussed the amazingness that is [**ChatGPT**](https://openai.com/blog /chatgpt/) but I'm not sure I expressed how freaked out I am by it. Give it a try yourself, it's jaw-dropping, and might make you wonder about a lot. (Update - it seems that FDIC is blocking access to ChatGPT at the moment. Try it when you get home!)

- Starlink is only one of the players beginning to crowd the heavens with satellite-based, direct-to-client internet services. [**Starlink's brother company SpaceX just launched**](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/worlds-heaviest-commercial-communications-satellite-will-launch-tonight/) the [world's heaviest communications satellite](https://www.hughes.com/what-we-offer/satellite-services/jupiter-geo-satellites/JUPITER3), which interestingly, belongs to their competitor, Hughes Network Systems.

- One of the many beautiful things about the FDIC (and maybe the US Government in general?) is transparency. At its best, you can feel like you're really getting the truth. [**This report from the FDIC OIG**](https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/summary-announcements/fdics-adoption-cloud-computing-services) - on the agency's adoption of cloud services - is one such case.

### Wednesday August 2

- If you're interested in a bit more detail about how vLANs work, particularly the "tagging" part, [**this is a pretty good**](https://www.networkacademy.io/ccna/ethernet/vlan-trunking) illustration of how the tag identifies the vLAN number. Nice little animations too.

- I briefly mentioned how Ethernet cables might be "tapped" using port monitoring or a hardware device. Far crazier is the undersea cable tapping/spying that the US conducted during the cold war. That's outlined in [**this fantastic book**](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/blind-mans-bluff-the-untold-story-of-american-submarine-espionage-by-sherry-sontag-christopher-drew/250927/). 

- As Ryan informed me - the OIG strikes again! Here they are looking into the FDIC's own deployment of Wi-Fi and [finding plenty to criticize](https://www.fdicoig.gov/reports-publications/review/security-controls-over-fdics-wireless-networks). Another great example of an organization holding itself to IT standards the right way, also some useful Wi-Fi tech hints we can talk about.

### Thursday August 3

- Nobody really asked for it, but I promise you, there are few better uses for your stray 40 minutes that to [**listen to this young man play this amazing music**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPJL488cfRw). His name is Yunchan Lim. The piece is Rachmaninoff's 3rd piano concerto.

- Here's a great little article about [**The Importance of Network Management Systems in Community Banks and Credit Unions**](https://www.safesystems.com/blog/2017/09/importance-network-management-systems-community-banks-credit-unions/).

- Here's a great, short, explainer on [**how TCP does its amazing job.**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) We don't have time to talk about all the details of TCP, like error correction and flow control, but they are super cool.

- Some companies are so powerful that they can just re-write lots of protocols and do things their way. That's what Google did when they developed and began using [**the QUIC protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to make up for what they perceived as weaknesses in TCP. If you ever use Google Chrome as your browser, you've almost certainly used it.
