title:  "July 31 - August 4, 2023 - FDIC Introduction to Telecommunications and Networking"
---
Welcome to our class on Telecommunications for the FDIC and other financial examiners. 

Telecommunications and Networking are at the heart of modern banking systems. Today, banking may be performed by customers anywhere, at any time, using a variety of devices.  Banking applications may be implemented in-house or by a service provider and all need networks to function.  

Before class each day, I'll put links to things we've talked about and other items of interest on this page. There is no requirement to view or otherwise use them, but you may find some interesting or useful.

### Monday July 31

- If you enjoy history, [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) is the guy who started modern data communications. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. 

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was **the guy** who figured out that **bits** would be the things we'd use to process, store, and communicate **information**. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious documentary!

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day last year when Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. And here's the cool thing: By the time we're through with our class, you'll know enough to understand most of it!

We'll put more links, comments, and resources here as our course progresses. The site will be available until August 11, 2023.
