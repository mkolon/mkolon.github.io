title:  "July 31 - August 4, 2023 - FDIC Introduction to Telecommunications and Networking"
---
Welcome to our class on Telecommunications for FDIC and other financial examiners. 

Telecommunications and Networking are at the heart of modern banking systems. Today, banking services are accessed by customers anywhere, at any time, using a variety of devices.  Banking applications may be implemented in-house or by a service provider, but all need networks to function. 

Before class each day, I'll put links to things we've talked about and other items of interest on this page. There is no requirement to view or otherwise use them, but I hope you find some interesting or useful.

### For Monday July 31

- If you enjoy history, [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) was the genius who enabled modern data communications. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- On the other hand, if you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**bits would be the things we'd use**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information online. It might seem obvious to you now, but it was pretty revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious documentary!

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while.  


This page will be available until August 11, 2023.
