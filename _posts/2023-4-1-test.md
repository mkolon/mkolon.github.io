This is only a test.

- This is a [**running list**](/assets/VPN_questions.html) of lame questions from a few weeks ago.

### Monday March 27th

- We'll talk about VPN topics in class of course, but an entertaining introduction to some of them [**can be found in this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY) by [Tom Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Scott_(presenter)).

- **Incognito Mode** on a web browser is a great way to keep what you're doing away from prying eyes on your (or a shared) computer, but it doesn't do anything to keep remote people from seeing what you're doing. Here are a couple decent articles about this, one from [Avast](https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-incognito-mode
) and one from [Bitcatcha](https://www.bitcatcha.com/blog/can-wifi-owner-see-what-sites-visited-incognito/).

- I must admit I love Cloudflare. Explainers like these, on [**Public Key Cryptography**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) and [**SSL Certificates**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/), are a big part of why I feel that way.
