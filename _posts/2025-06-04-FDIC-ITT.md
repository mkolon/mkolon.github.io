This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. **It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading.** But as we move through the week, I'll post links related to class topics, assignments, and other interesting nuggets.

### Monday June 23

- You may find the story of [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) interesting. His work made modern data communications possible. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material. And where do you think Anthropic [**got the name for their AI**](https://claude.ai/new)? (If you're on an FDIC or State computer, that last link may be broken, sorry. We'll talk about why in class...)

- If you're bored by history, that's a shame, but just know that Claude S is the guy who figured out that [**we should use bits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information. It might seem obvious now, but it was quite revolutionary in 1948. There â€“ now you don't need to watch a tedious historical documentary! How do you think Shannon's work influenced how banks operate today?

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. **What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate?** Could that happen?

### Tuesday June 24

- I mentioned that I am involved with a tiny fiber ISP called [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com) here in Northern Vermont. Broadband to the people!

- Some companies are so powerful that they can just re-write lots of protocols and do things their way. That's what Google did when they developed and began using [**the QUIC protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to make up for what they perceived as weaknesses in TCP. If you ever use Google Chrome as your browser, you've almost certainly used QUIC.

- Here's a living document I'll continue to develop this week, a [**glossary/risk list**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/glossary.txt) for topics in this class. It's incomplete and kind of lame at this point, it will get better this week. That is, if you help me keep an eye on it and ask good questions for me to answer and add.

- As you can see, one physical layer risk is cable tapping. It's hard to imagine that being done against a community bank, but hey, never say never! The US did this during the cold war, a crazy story that's outlined in [**this fantastic book**](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/blind-mans-bluff-the-untold-story-of-american-submarine-espionage-by-sherry-sontag-christopher-drew/250927/).
