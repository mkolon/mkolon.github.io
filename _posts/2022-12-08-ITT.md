---

Welcome to our Intro to Telecom and Networking class (we call it ITT for short.) Here are a few things to get you thinking about topics we'll cover during the week:

- A [**running list**](https://files.hill.com/assets/ITT_questions.html) of questions I might ask if I were an examiner of banks. Of course, since I'm a network geek, these are ones related to this class. There are many others related to other aspects of networks that I try to raise in other classes.

### Monday December 12

- If you enjoy history, [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) is the guy who started modern data communications. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. 

- If you hate history, just know this: Claude S was **the guy** who figured out that **bits** would be the things we'd use to process, store, and communicate **information**. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious documentary!

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day last year when Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. And here's the cool thing: By the time we're through with our class, you'll know enough to understand most of it!

### Tuesday December 13

- I mentioned that I am involved with a tiny fiber ISP called [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com) here in Northern Vermont. Broadband to the people!

- We briefly looked at the amazingness that is [**ChatGPT**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) but I'm not sure I expressed how freaked out I am by it. Give it a try yourself, it's jaw-dropping, and might make you wonder about what humanity means...

### Wednesday December 14

- If you're interested in a bit more detail about how vLANs work, particularly the "tagging" part, [**this is a pretty good**](https://www.networkacademy.io/ccna/ethernet/vlan-trunking) illustration of how the tag identifies the vLAN number. Nice little animations too.

- I briefly mentioned the undersea cable tapping/spying that the US conducted during the cold war. That's outlined in [**this fantastic book**](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/blind-mans-bluff-the-untold-story-of-american-submarine-espionage-by-sherry-sontag-christopher-drew/250927/). Relatedly, Pat reminded me of the [**story of the Glomar Explorer**](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/during-cold-war-ci-secretly-plucked-soviet-submarine-ocean-floor-using-giant-claw-180972154/), which is one of the more bizarre episodes of spycraft I've heard. That story is also in the linked book.

### Thursday December 15

- Here's a great, short, explainer on [**how TCP does its amazing job.**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) We don't have time to talk about all the details of TCP, like error correction and flow control, but they are super cool.

- Some companies are so powerful that they can just re-write lots of protocols and do things their way. That's what Google did when they developed and began using [**the QUIC protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to make up for what they perceived as weaknesses in TCP. If you ever use Google Chrome as your browser, you've almost certainly used it.

- The Internet Society on [**how TLS works.**](https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/) It's a bit old but still largely correct and clear.

- An article from Webroot on [**the importance of DNS security**](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/dns-security-best-practices), and here's another [**pretty good article**](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/dns-security-best-practices-preventing-dns-hijacking-poisoning-and-redirection/) from Infosec on the same topic.

- There is a relatively new, more secure version of the DNS protocol called DNSSEC, which is just beginning to see broad deployment. Cloudflare has a [**great short article**](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/) on how it works.

### Friday December 16

- Cloudflare has a [**great explainer on**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) Public Key Cryptography and some other crypto things.

- Also on [**Certificates**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/), which are the authentication component of SSL/TLS and HTTPS.

- Verizon's very comprehensive [**Data Breach Investigation Report**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) for 2022. You can read it online or register to download a copy.

- I don't have my copy of this [**Manga Guide to Cryptography**](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Cryptography-Guides/dp/1593277423/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=manga+crypto&qid=1671396861&sr=8-1) yet, but I will soon. It costs $15, but maybe a gift for that millenial cryptographic geek on your shopping list?
