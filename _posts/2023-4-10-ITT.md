Welcome to our class on Telecommunications for the FDIC and other financial examiners. 

Telecommunications and Networking are at the heart of modern information systems.  Applications meet the needs of users with networks sharing the
information with the servers performing the work.  Today, banking may be performed by customers anywhere, at any time, using a variety of devices.  Banking applications may be implemented in-house or by a service provider and all need networks to function.  
In this course, participants will 
receive a comprehensive view of current telecommunications and networking options with examples of their use.
