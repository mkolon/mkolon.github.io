This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/DIIF-20240805.pptx) for the week.

### Monday August 5

- As we will see, firewalls and other security elements are themselves [**continually under attack**](https://www.databreachtoday.com/cisco-fixes-firewall-0-days-after-likely-nation-state-hack-a-24934). This is just one recent example that could compromise community banks given the type of device targeted. 
- Here's another [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- A few things that came up in discussion this morning:
  - [**Firewalla** cybersecurity](https://firewalla.com/)
  - [**Bullwall** ransomware protection](https://bullwall.com/)
  - The [**OPNsense**](https://opnsense.org/) open-source network security project.
- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only widely publicised a couple of months ago. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."
- If you don't understand why perimeter-centric, firewall-based security is old and busted, and what banks need to do about it, [**please read this**](https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/zero-trust/definitions/what-is-zero-trust-network-access-ztna/) - it's just one of many good ZTNA explainers for mortals. If you're feeling super-human and you want more detail from a federal perspectective, [**please be my guest**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
