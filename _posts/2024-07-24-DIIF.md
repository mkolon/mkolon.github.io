title:  "August 5, 2024 - FDIC Deploying Internet and Intranet Firewalls"
---

This page links to resources that might be interesting or useful during class. It's not an assignment and nothing here is required reading. As we move through the week, I'll post more links related to class topics or other interesting nuggets.

Here's a [**link to the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/DIIF-20240805.pptx) for the week.

### Monday August 5

- How many banks have you visited that have Cisco devices securing their internet connection? [**This little problem**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-10-000-cisco-devices-hacked-in-ios-xe-zero-day-attacks/) apparently only affects the Cisco OS version called IOS XE. You might add a check for that (and the patch) to your exam checklist.
- As we will see, firewalls and other security elements are themselves [**continually under attack**](https://www.databreachtoday.com/cisco-fixes-firewall-0-days-after-likely-nation-state-hack-a-24934). This is just one recent example that could compromise community banks given the type of device targeted. 
- Here's another [**a bit of easy pre-reading**](https://www.sayers.com/articles/the-future-of-firewalls-engineering-experts-reveal-the-path-ahead/) if you'd like to see where we're headed.
- A few things that came up in discussion this morning:
  - [**Firewalla** cybersecurity](https://firewalla.com/)
  - [**Bullwall** ransomware protection](https://bullwall.com/)
  - The [**OPNsense**](https://opnsense.org/) open-source network security project.
- This [**astonishing VPN attack**](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/) was only widely publicised a couple of months ago. You might call it "the revenge of DHCP."
- If you don't understand why perimeter-centric, firewall-based security is old and busted, and what banks need to do about it, [**please read this**](https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/zero-trust/definitions/what-is-zero-trust-network-access-ztna/) - it's just one of many good ZTNA explainers for mortals. If you're feeling super-human and you want more detail from a federal perspectective, [**please be my guest**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf).
- We had to blow past it pretty fast today, so here is [**a great article**](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-tcp-work/) about how TCP does its amazing job.
- Passwords are not very secure. Read [**this how-to article**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server) if you want to understand why I don't have to log into boingit, and why it's much more secure that way.
  

### Tuesday August 6

- For our "Find a Firewall" exercise:
  - [**Here's the topology**](https://boingit.com/fdic/fdic-diif/faf.png)
- And here are some links to the vendors:
  - [**Fortinet**](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall)
  - [**Palo Alto**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware)
  - [**SonicWall**](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/)
  - [**Barracuda**](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/next-generation-security)
  - [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html#tabs-9e2187ae1d-item-4b92b35855-tab)
- You don't have to use these links, I'm providing them as shortcuts to what seem to be the best sources of information for the exercise. You can look for, research, and use any platform from your vendor that you think fits the need.

- As you saw in the exercise, firewalls can do lots of different things these days. Here's a list of some ways [**firewalls can serve as network security**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Firewall-Controls.docx) controls.

  
### Wednesday August 7

- For the "Bank Firewall Topologies" exercise (on slides 192-194) I somehow forgot the topologies. [**So here they are**](https://boingit.com/firewalls/assets/bank_topos.png).
- Here are some ideas for [**questions about firewalls and network security**](https://class.hillvt.com/assets/Firewall-question-ideas.docx) that might help you to develop or tighten up your own.
- Palo Alto Networks has a good tutorial on [**How to think about Firewall Rules**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-are-firewall-rules) that you might find interesting.
- I wish we had had more time to just chat about SD-WAN, but because we didn't, I want to leave you with links to some good explainers. Every one is different, because they're all from vendors who claim to know the answer best. But if you read them all, you will come to an understanding... ;)
