Here's a link to [**the PowerPoint file**](https://class.hill.com/assets/ITT-2023-10-16.pptx) for this week.

### Monday October 16

- If you enjoy history, [**Claude Shannon**](https://www.historyofdatascience.com/claude-shannon/) was the genius who enabled modern data communications. If you prefer your history in movie form, there is a cute [**short documentary**](https://thebitplayer.com/) about him. You needn't watch the whole thing ([**it's on Amazon Prime**](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Player-John-Hutton/dp/B08D2TXKSX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E4Z8DHU6MWW9&keywords=bit+player+movie&qid=1670604926&sprefix=bit+player+movie%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1) if you want to), but you might find at least [**the trailer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3OldEtfBrE) interesting. The flaming trumpet and AI mouse are just bonus material.

- On the other hand, if you hate history, just know this: Claude S was the guy who figured out that [**bits would be the things we'd use**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) to process, store, and communicate information online. It might seem obvious now, but it was pretty revolutionary - even controversial - in 1948. There, now you don't need to watch a tedious documentary!

- Remember that ~~great~~ horrible day in October 2021 when all of Meta's properties (meaning Facebook/Insta/WhatsApp/etc) disappeared from the internet for about 6 hours? [**This is why that happened.**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/) The article is pretty detailed, and you probably won't grok it all quite yet, but a quick scan might give you some ideas. By the time we're through with class, you'll know enough to understand most of it. What if it had not been Meta, but a Core Banking Service Provider who had suffered this fate? Could that happen?

- Banks and everyone else have been moving apps to the cloud for many reasons, but this article explains why [**the mainframe computer isn't going anywhere**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/the-ibm-mainframe-how-it-runs-and-why-it-survives/), at least for a while.

### Tuesday October 17

- [**There**](https://about.att.com/innovation/ip/brands/history) are [**many**](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/history-of-att) accounts of [**ATT's**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation) history. My version is that Ma Bell was broken up by the FCC for monopolistic tendencies, and one of the so-called "Baby Bells" that resuted from that (SBC) eventually grew to consume the shattered corpse of her mother, and lots more besides. But it's a wild ride from any side.

- I mentioned that I am involved with a tiny fiber ISP called [**Mansfield Community Fiber**](https://mcfibervt.com) here in Northern Vermont. Broadband to the people!

- Here's a great report on [**how Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2023/07/21/how-turing-award-winner-bob-metcalfe-invented-the-ethernet/). Maybe the bar-napkin story isn't true after all. The video describes some real cowboy technology. 

- Some companies who do these kinds of things in 2023. We might talk about them (and others) some:
  - [Meraki](https://meraki.cisco.com/)
  - [Juniper Networks](https://juniper.net)
  - [Ubiquiti](https://store.ui.com/us/en)
  - [Extreme Networks](https://www.extremenetworks.com/)
  - [Ruckus](https://www.ruckusnetworks.com/)
