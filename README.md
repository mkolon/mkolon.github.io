This repo contains the infrastructure and always-changing content for the class.hillvt.com website, served 
by Github pages. The infra is jekyll, because it's awesome and because it's how Pages works. I change the 
content each time I teach a class, usually just by adding a post and adding what we need to the assets. I
typically take down (and remove) each post a week or so after the class.

If you want access to the assets from a long-ago class, leave a note and I'll try to help.
