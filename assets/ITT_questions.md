- Can you lead me through an overview of your network with a topology diagram?
- Do you use any fiber-optic cable in your LAN or otherwise?
- Do you use any vLANs? Can you tell me about them? They are hard to show in diagrams.
- Do you have any Wi-Fi in the bank? How do you protect it?
- How are you connected to the internet?
- Is your internet connection device a router, firewall, SD-WAN device, or something else?
- Is your DNS server or services safe? How do you know?
